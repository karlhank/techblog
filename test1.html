		<td style="width: 487px" valign="top">Are you experiencing windows 
		popping up on your PC claiming you have a virus infection?<br />
		<br />
		You can&#39;t access any web sites or do anything with your browser because 
		of &quot;virus&quot; warnings?<br />
		<br />
		There is a threat to the PCs in your office and in your home. This 
		threat is from fake security software called Scareware or Ransomware.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>What is Scareware?</strong><br />
		A scareware attack is a legitimate looking security application that 
		“pops” up as you are browsing the web. These applications go by many, 
		many names such as Antivirus 2009, Antivirus 2010, Antivirus Agent Pro, 
		Advanced Virus Remover and Antivirus+ or Security Tool. The makers of 
		these applications prey upon unsuspecting users with unethical marketing 
		practices designed to cause shock, anxiety or the perception of a 
		threat.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>How do you recognize a scareware attack?</strong><br />
		Scareware attacks usually have several common behaviors. They will 
		pretend to be scanning your machine, often with an animated progress 
		bar. They will usually say that your machine is infected with one or 
		more viruses or malicious software, or malware. These scans are fake and 
		they have no way to access your hard drive. They often show logos of 
		reputable sites they say recommend their software. They may also have 
		graphs and charts expounding the ability their software has in cleaning 
		your PC. They usually look very legitimate. Some will show realistic 
		Microsoft Windows screens. Click
		<a href="http://content.zdnet.com/2346-12691_22-342083.html">here</a> to 
		see some examples of scareware windows. It is important that when you 
		see one of these windows that you do not click on any part of the 
		window. Often the criminals who make these screens make them one giant 
		button that if clicked will allow malicious software to be installed on 
		your machine.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Where do the attacks come from?</strong><br />
		Cybercriminals are always looking for new ways to spread their malware. 
		Hijacked search terms pointing to illegitimate websites is a popular 
		method. The attackers use popular search terms to point users to their 
		websites. Another method is malicious advertising, or malvertising. 
		Malvertising is the practice of serving malicious ads on legitimate 
		websites. Your PC can get infected by simply browsing to a legitimate 
		website. These websites do their best to limit these ads but it can be a 
		challenge.<br />
		<br />
		<strong>What can we do to protect ourselves?</strong><br />
		· Prevention is the best medicine. The best way that you can protect 
		yourselves is to pay attention to the links you are clicking on. If it 
		does not seem legitimate it probably is not.<br />
		<br />
		· Be careful of attachments and links in emails. If you were not 
		expecting the email it is better to ask the sender if they sent you the 
		email than to risk a virus or malware infection. I look for something 
		personalized from the sender such as a how-are-you note or something 
		else that tells you it was sent by the sender and not by malicious 
		software on their machine.<br />
		<br />
		· Be careful of links to foreign countries. Links that have a .cn or .ru 
		instead of .com.<br />
		<br />
		· Of course even the most careful person will eventually be presented 
		with one of these scareware windows. When a scareware window “pops” up 
		do not click on any part of the window. Even the red “X” in the corner. 
		The best way to close these windows is to use Alt-F4. Press and hold 
		down the Alt key and then press F4 and current window will close. You 
		might need to press F4 multiple times to get all the scareware windows 
		to close. The other method to close these windows is to right click on 
		the windows taskbar icon at the bottom of your monitor and select close. 
		One of these method should allow you to safely close the malicious 
		windows.<br />
		<br />
		· If for whatever reason you can’t get the scareware windows to close, 
		then turn off your PC. Just hold the power button down until the PC 
		shuts down. Don’t try to exit Windows.<br />
		<br />
		If it happens at your home, there are several legitimate websites and 
		software you can use to scan your PC.

		for a link to a list of legitimate online scanning websites. There are a 
		couple of free applications that have worked well for us in removing 
		malware and adware from PCs. One is called Malwarebytes and can be
